This is my first ever React application. I made it while learning to work with React for front-end web development. It's a very simple application that displays whether it's hot or cold in a user's region by getting their latitude using google's geolocation APIs and taking into account the time of the year. Because it only takes latitude and time of year into account, it is by no means an accurate predictor and doesn't consider all the various other factors that apply to professional weather prediction.
