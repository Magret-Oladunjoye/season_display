This is my first ever React application. I made it while learning to work with React for front-end web development. It's a very simple application that displays one of two options to a user: whether it's cold or hot in the user's region depending on time of year and latitude. The user's latitude is gotten(with permission) using google's geolocation APIs. Because it only takes latitude and time of year into account, it is by no means an accurate predictor and doesn't consider all the various other factors that apply to professional weather prediction.
